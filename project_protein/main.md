# Main Document

## Project Overview

This repository contains scripts for processing and testing protein/DNA data. Key files:

- `hw6_protein.py`: Core implementation.
- `hw6_protein_tests.py`: Test suite.
- `data/`: Supporting data files (e.g. `codon_table.json`, sample DNA text files).

## Project Structure

## Dependencies

This project uses standard Python 3 features. Python 3.8+ is recommended.

To run tests with `pytest`, install it first:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pytest
```

## Running and Testing

1. Run the main script (if it is executable):

```bash
python3 hw6_protein.py
```

2. Run tests (recommended using `pytest`):

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q
```

If `pytest` is not available, you can run the test script directly (depending on how tests are implemented):

```bash
python3 hw6_protein_tests.py
```

## Uploading Changes to GitHub (example steps)

The following commands assume the repository is initialized locally and you have unstaged changes. They show how to commit and push `main.md` to a remote GitHub repository:

```zsh
# Check repository status
git status

# Stage the new file and commit
git add main.md
git commit -m "Add main.md: project documentation"

# If you haven't set a remote yet, add one (replace with your repo URL):
git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO.git

# Push to the default branch (e.g. main or master)
git push -u origin main
```

Note: Pushing requires write access to the remote repository and proper Git credentials (SSH key or HTTPS credentials) configured locally.

## Next Steps

- If you want, I can generate the exact `git` commands for you to run locally, or I can run `git add`/`git commit` here if you grant permission for me to execute those commands in this environment.
- If you need a more detailed `README` with API examples, function documentation, or contribution guidelines, tell me what to include and I will expand this file.
